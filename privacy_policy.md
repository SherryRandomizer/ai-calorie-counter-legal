<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="updated">Last updated: October 3, 2026</p>

<p>AI Calorie Counter ("we", "our", "the app") is developed by Shoaib Jamil, based in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. This Privacy Policy explains what information the app collects, how it is used, and the choices you have.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<h2>1. Account Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Email address (used to create and sign in to your account)</li>
  <li>Password (stored securely via Firebase Authentication; we never see your plain-text password)</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Health and Fitness Information</h2>
<p>To provide personalized nutrition tracking, the app collects information you choose to provide, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Weight, height, age, gender, activity level, and weight goals</li>
  <li>Body measurements (waist, chest, hips, arms, thighs) if you choose to log them</li>
  <li>Meals you log, including photos of food, text/voice descriptions, nutrition values, and timestamps</li>
  <li>Water intake, fasting session history, and supplement/vitamin intake you choose to track</li>
  <li>Notes you add to logged meals</li>
</ul>
<p>This information is used solely to calculate your personalized calorie and macronutrient goals, track your progress, and power the app's AI-based suggestions. It is never sold.</p>

<h2>3. Photos and AI Analysis</h2>
<p>When you take or upload a photo of food, a fridge/pantry, or a barcode, the image is sent securely to our backend service, which forwards it to OpenAI's API for analysis (identifying food and estimating nutrition, or identifying ingredients for recipe suggestions). Barcode scans are also checked against the free, open Open Food Facts database. Photos are processed for this purpose and are not permanently stored by us beyond what's needed to complete your request, unless you choose to save a meal (in which case only the resulting nutrition data — not the photo itself — is stored in your account).</p>

<h2>4. Microphone (Voice Input)</h2>
<p>If you use voice input to describe a meal, your device's speech-to-text engine processes your speech locally/on-device to produce text, which you can review and edit before it's analyzed. We do not store audio recordings.</p>

<h2>5. Location</h2>
<p>With your permission, the app uses your device's approximate location to fetch local weather data, which is used to adjust your daily water intake goal on hot days. Location is only used for this purpose and is not stored or shared.</p>

<h2>6. Device and Usage Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Advertising ID — used to serve ads via Google AdMob (see "Advertising" below)</li>
  <li>App usage analytics (via Firebase Analytics) — helps us understand how the app is used so we can improve it</li>
  <li>Crash and error reports (via Firebase Crashlytics) — helps us identify and fix bugs</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To provide and personalize the app's core features (calorie/macro tracking, AI meal analysis, progress charts, reminders, and more)</li>
  <li>To improve the app's reliability and performance</li>
  <li>To display advertisements (free tier only)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
<p>Your data is stored securely using Google Firebase (Firestore database and Firebase Authentication), a widely used and secure cloud platform. We have taken additional steps to protect your data and our systems, including Firebase App Check (which verifies that requests come from the genuine app) and routing AI requests through a secure backend that never exposes API keys to the app itself.</p>

<h2>Advertising</h2>
<p>Free-tier users may see ads served through Google AdMob. AdMob may collect your advertising ID and other technical information to serve relevant ads. You can review Google's practices at their <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Advertising Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The app uses the following third-party services, each with their own privacy practices:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Google Firebase (authentication, database, analytics, crash reporting, app verification)</li>
  <li>Google AdMob (advertising)</li>
  <li>OpenAI (food/ingredient recognition and nutrition estimation, accessed via our secure backend — OpenAI does not receive your account information, only the image or text needed to complete your request)</li>
  <li>Open Food Facts (free, open barcode/product database)</li>
  <li>Open-Meteo / weather data providers (for location-based water goal adjustments)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your Choices</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You can edit or delete any meal, weight entry, or other logged data at any time within the app.</li>
  <li>You can export your data (meals, weight, water history) as CSV files from Profile → Settings.</li>
  <li>You can permanently delete your account and all associated data from Profile → Settings → Delete Account. This action is irreversible.</li>
  <li>You can revoke camera, microphone, or location permissions at any time via your device settings; the relevant features will simply be unavailable until re-granted.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>This app is not directed at children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time as the app evolves. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.</p>
